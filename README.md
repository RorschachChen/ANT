author="Markvica, David and Schauer, Christian and Raidl, G{\"u}nther R."
abstract="We analyze the runtime behavior of an ant colony optimization approach for the longest common subsequence problem executed on a many-core GPU and a multi-core CPU. Our approach is a parallelized variant of a previously published algorithm. Moreover, we are able to significantly improve the results of the original one by adapting the heuristic function of the ant colony algorithm. Our results show that despite its many more cores the GPU has no significant advantages over the CPU-based approach.",
